User’s functionalities are to register, view his donation details i.e., when and where he donated blood previously and also view his requesting details i.e., how much amount of blood of a blood group he requested previously. 
This System is a replacement to the existing Blood Bank Management System, so as to reduce human work. This system can be accessed by all the intended users, all the time based on the Network Availability through a desktop computer or personal mobile device.

Users have to contact their allocated Blood Bank to donate blood or to have required amount of blood. The proposed system helps the management in searching blood in different areas. This system ensures maintainability. This System has scope to make changes easily, because it has been developed by using the feature of Modularity.
