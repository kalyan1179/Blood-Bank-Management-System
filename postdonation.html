        <li><p>Following your donation, you will receive refreshments.</p></li>

        <li><p>After donating, it is recommended that you increase your fluid intake for the next 24 to 48 hours; avoid strenuous physical exertion, heavy lifting or pulling with the donation arm for about five hours; and eat well balanced meals for the next 24 hours.</p></li>

       <li><p>Smoking and alcohol consumption is not recommended after donation. Although donors seldom experience discomfort after donating, if you feel light-headed, lie down until the feeling passes.</li></ul></p></b>
