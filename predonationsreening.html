        <li>During pre-donation screening, a blood bank employee will ask you some questions about your health, lifestyle, and disease risk factors. All of this information is confidential.</li>

        <li>An employee will perform a short health exam, taking your pulse, temperature and blood pressure. A drop of blood from your finger will also be tested to ensure that your blood iron level is sufficient for you to donate.</li>

        <li>All medical equipment used for this test, as well as during the donation process, is sterile, used only once and then disposed.</li></ul>
